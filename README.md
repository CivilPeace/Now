# Now
Civil Protocol is the framework and platform for a Civil Economy.  Civil Peace is possible when inflation on property, goods and services are low or even negative.  Resident Owned Communities are built as commercial commons for the benefit of Residents and the surrounding areas.  We create a Network Effect, Civil Effect and a commercial commons that together is an unmatched force in any economic system known.  This is due to the fact that no other program, platform or system works directly at the root causes of inflation.   Private, public or personal inflationary cost of living or operating businesses are dramatically reduced or eliminated.  We can Live, Work, Eat and Play at a lower inflationary cost then by any other economic means.  
# How
1st.) Civil Peace starts with Residents owning their land and housing.
2nd.) A commercial commons is established within the Resident Owned Community.
3rd.) Civil Benefit Organizations are established by anyone.  These CBO's are Certified Civil Peace brand and network ambassadors.  CBO's pay the normal lot rent as residents and contribute an ultra low community inflation reduction fee of 3% of net profits.  This network fee covers marketing, transaction fees, and associated business expenses normally incurred by an enterprise.  This creates an extremely low overhead for any type of business.  Most if not all benefits are included that would be realized by an Angel Investor or business incubator.  Why give away 30% of your company when the civil commons can get you the help, exposure, property, and equipment you need to start or expand your empire.  

# Why
We have studied, practiced and lived all known alternative economic systems.  This has been already accomplished as a group through the human experience.  Namely the Social Market, Solidarity Economy, Collectives, Cooperatives, and Communal systems.  Why aren't these enough to replace good old Capitalism?  Well there are too many reasons to list.  Traditional Capitalism is the only currently viable economic system to spread wealth to humanity. This is surely not without it's flaws and inefficiencies.  There are more losers than winners in old capitalism if you track the ratio of gains and losses to each population.  Chances are that compared to the multiplying factors of Network Effect, Civil Effect and a "commercial" Civil Commons, old capitalism is probably still at a negative growth factor to all participants.  This negative effect is still better than the alternatives.  This is why alternative systems to old capitalism have and most likely never succeeded to any great or useful extent.  So what is the answer?  We believe that a Civil Protocol that combines the multiplying factors of Network Effect, Civil Effect and a commercial Civil Commons when combined takes us from a negative growth factor to a positive one.  This in turn through a Civil Protocol and Resident Owned Communities lowers the inflation cost experienced by all people and businesses.  We call this Civil Capitalism.  This new economic system takes the concepts of Depin, DAO, RWA's, NTF's and cryptocurrencies to a place that no one really expected.  We can use technology to plug the siphoning holes in old capitalism.  Civil Capitalism just takes all the available technology and forks it to produce revenue to buy, build, and expand Resident Owned Communities in all parts of the world.  This is where the concept of Civil Peace ties in to create a Perpetual Purpose.  By living in ROC'c with a commercial Civil Commons we get to experience what Civil Peace is capable of.  World wide we can start to secure populations in their home countries.  This in turn slows immigration.  When people have alternatives to high inflation, crime, housing and food insecurity they will stay and build something amazing.  This is Civil Peace.  This is Civil Capitalism.

# Civil Rule
No good deed, goes unpunished. Every civil deed, has benefit.

Start or join a Civil Benefit Organization.  Buy a property in a commercial Civil Commons (Resident Owned Community).

# Civil Motto
Civil Peace mighty not be sexy... though how it works is F'ing amazing!
Network Effect + Civil Effect + commercial Civil Commons creates the highest multiplying factor of all efforts.
Long live, Civil Capitalism.

All of this without the help or hindrance of socialism, mutualism, meritism, collectivism, or communalism.
